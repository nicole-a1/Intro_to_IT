  <h2 id="about">ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p> Hello and welcome! My name is Nicole, I’m 29 and I’m from Sydney. Like most of the country and the world, I’m currently attempting to make it through the COVID pandemic. Maybe also like some, I’m seizing the opportunity to change directions in life by undertaking further study, this time in IT. </p>
    <p>I have a Bachelor of Science majoring in pharmacology from the University of New South Wales and while it was an engaging and fascinating three years, having found a job while finishing the degree, I fell into the high of earning a wage over further study and so for the past eight years, I have been working in a completely unrelated field as a transcript typist which has been fascinating in its own way. While I really enjoy this job as it consists of some of my favourite things - listening to stories, typing, nit-picking at punctuation and grammar mistakes - I feel it's time for a change and hope to one day get out there and try new things, hopefully in the IT industry.</p>
    <p>In my downtime, I love reading, especially fantasy and sci-fi with a smattering of general and historical fiction thrown in now and again, and catching up on TV shows and movies. I also love playing games (PlayStation is my platform of choice) though I'm not very good at them. Unfortunately with the current lockdowns, I haven’t been able to enjoy one of the few outdoor activities I actually like: cycling, as my favourite track is more than 5 kilometres from home.</p>

  <h2 id="interest">INTEREST IN IT</h2>
    <h3>What piqued my interest in IT?</h3>
      <p>I’ve always had a general, low-level interest in IT in terms of things like the development of technology, the future prospects career-wise, the breadth of the industry. I would say my interest began when I first heard that sound of dial up connecting and was able to chat with friends after school on MSN, and it has continued to grow in strength to the present day as I’ve watched technology advancements, software developments and improvements to network infrastructure lead to things that are in use every day like smartphones, smart TVs, ADSL to cable to the NBN internet, VR gaming headsets, and much more.</p>
      <p>Growing up, I never really thought about what went into creating these devices and the programs and applications that I use every day, and the consequences of using them. Now more than ever with the integration of technology in our lives, I am intrigued by not only the positive benefits that have come from this progress, such as medical alert alarms for the elderly or vulnerable, to being able to turn light switches and air conditioners on and off through a mobile phone, but also the negatives, such as security concerns in terms of personal data, privacy and the prevalence of cyberbullying, amongst other issues.</p>
      <p>What pushed me to really begin considering following this interest in IT was a random job search one quiet evening, just trying to get an idea of what else was out there. What I found opened up an entirely new world made up of software developers, business and system analysts, IT engineers and cybersecurity analysts and many more. Researching the tasks performed by all of these professionals, the breadth of skills needed as well as the variety of industries advertising in the IT industry - ranging from the health industry, education and construction sectors and more in between - definitely lit the spark that led to me enrolling in this course, hoping to learn more about how developments in IT has led to a complete change in the way we live, and one day I hope to gain enough skills and experience to enter the exciting world of IT.</p>

    <h3>IT experience?</h3>
      <p>I would consider my IT experience to be rather limited due to the fact that my experience has been more of an end user rather than anything else. While I enjoy reaping the benefits of advances in IT, from the incredible graphics in new games, to the ability to continue working during a pandemic, to the convenience that comes with using a smartphone, I hope this course will enable me to have a better understanding of the different features that comprise the IT industry, as well as the positives and negatives of integrating IT into our lives so completely.</p>

    <h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
      <p>As we move online more and more, the ability to provide great opportunities from things like working from home for some during pandemics and online learning is something that has developed through the years. RMIT through Open Universities Australia offers an extremely flexible program that fits around full-time work as it is 100% online (meaning I can study from the comforts of home in Sydney) and the Bachelor of IT course appeared to be one of the more well-rounded courses available, especially for beginners who have no idea where their interests may lie, making RMIT seem like the perfect choice.</p>

    <h3>What do I expect to learn?</h3>
      <p>Being relatively new to the subject, I hope to develop my understanding in relation to the way we use technology and the developments that have led to us being able to lead more efficient and productive lives. But while there are positives, I would also like to delve into the limitations and drawbacks of relying so much on technology - from health issues that comes from sitting in front of a screen for long periods of time, to a decrease in educational standards of children, such as being unable to handwrite using pen and paper or even spell or tell time, to the consequences of the world having such a massive online presence, especially in relation to things like dissemination of sensitive information and personal safety.</p>

  <h2 id="ideal">IDEAL JOB</h2>
    <p>Being not only by nature an extremely pedantic and detail-oriented person, but also as a result of having been a transcript typist for such a long period which has further developed my eye for detail, combined with my love of finding problems and figuring out how to fix things them, my ideal job would have to be:</p>

  <h3>SOFTWARE QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER</h3>

  </div>

    <h4>Role</h4>
      <p>A software quality assurance engineer essentially is heavily involved in the software development cycle, working in conjunction with the client or company, software developers and teams of quality analysts to ensure that the end product is both functional, and produces the expected outcomes (Doyle 2019). Day to day activities may include things such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identifying any issues during the software development process to mitigate potential end user problems and finding solutions through tasks such as:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>coding automated tests</li>
              <li>creating test plan</li>
              <li>creating and maintaining records of tests and</li>
              <li>analysing errors or bugs found</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Reporting back to the different groups involved, from the software development teams creating the product, to the test analyst teams and even to the company or client who has commissioned the project.</li>
        </ul>

      <h4>Skills, Qualifications and Experience Required</h4>
        <p>A software quality assurance engineer must have a good grasp of both technical skills and what are considered soft skills (Doyle 2019). The fact that the QA engineer is responsible for coordinating and providing information to various teams requires them to be able to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>communicate effectively in both written and oral forms</li>
            <li>work as part of a team </li>
            <li>manage time effectively in order to meet deadlines and ensure smooth running of the process</li>
            <li>have a great attention to detail</li>
            <li>analyse and solve problems that might arise during the development and testing phases</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Technical skills required include things such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>knowledge of various programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, etc</li>
            <li>knowledge of software testing applications such as Jira, TestLink, Confluence, amongst others</li>
            <li>experience with all stages of the software development life cycle </li>
          </ul>
        <p>Often, practical experience takes a more prominent role over tertiary qualifications in particular, as most companies generally search for people who have prior experience in a test analyst or quality assurance role. However, most also require at least a bachelor's degree or even masters in fields such as computer science, software design or engineering, or information technology (Doyle 2019).</p>

      <h4>Skills, qualifications and experience I currently possess</h4>
        <p>As of this moment, though I am highly interested in pursuing this type of career path, I do have little to no technical skills, qualifications or experience to perform any of these tasks. Hopefully by the end of my time at RMIT, I will have gained enough skills to have a strong foundation to build upon in order to pursue a career in the IT industry, in such positions as above or similar.</p>
        <p>However, I believe I have a strong foundation in skills such as communication, working as part of a team and time management. Having worked as a coordinator for five plus years, I am able to manage teams, allocate and distribute work based on my knowledge of the ability of my team members and organise my time so that work is completed on time. My role at work also requires great attention to detail and the ability to quickly find errors in documents and make changes to fix them.</p>

      <h4>Bridging the gap between my current skills and the skills necessary to become a Software Quality Assurance Engineer</h4>
        <p>Firstly, I aim to complete a Bachelor of Information Technology with RMIT in order to obtain the necessary educational foundation to build upon. At this point, an internship or even an entry level position in a tech company would be beneficial, in order to gain practical experience in an IT workplace. To further my knowledge, either while studying or after graduating, and to keep up with changes to the industry, I would complete short courses from platforms such as Skill Finder, which
        provides free online courses provided by a variety of tech companies, or even from more specifically tailored platforms such as Codecademy where individuals can learn different programming and markup languages.</p>

  <h2 id="profile">PERSONAL PROFILE</h2>
    <h3>MYERS-BRIGGS TYPE INDICATOR</h3>
      <p>The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is a questionnaire designed by Isabel Briggs Myers and Katharine Briggs which helps individuals discover their psychological profile based on the theories of Carl G Jung (The Myers & Briggs Foundation, c 2021). The instrument identifies and describes 16 personality types based on input from individuals.</p>

      <h4>Test Results</h4>
        <div class="image">
        <img src="myers_briggs.png" alt="ISFP-T Adventurer Personality Type" class="responsive">
        </div>

      <h4>What do these results mean?</h4>
        <p>An ISFP-T personality type is someone who pushes the boundaries of convention. They love trying new things, are creative and unconventional in their approaches. They are also passionate and are able to focus intensely on things that catch their interest (NERIS Analytics Limited, c 2011). ISFP Ts may also be a little introverted, preferring to work alone than with others but despite this, are able to contribute effectively while in a group setting. They are often also modest and unwilling to draw attention to themselves, but willing to help others in supporting-type roles (Owens c 2020, NERIS Analytics Limited, c 2011).</p>
        <div id="table">
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Strenths</th>
              <th>Weaknesses</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Imaginative</td>
              <td>Intense individuality</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Sensitivity</td>
              <td>Unpredictability</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Likeable</td>
              <td>Competitiveness</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Passionate</td>
              <td>Easily stressed</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Curious</td>
              <td>Fluctuating self-esteem</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </div>

      <h4>How do these results influence my behaviour in a team?</h4>
        <p>Due to their quiet and easy-going natures and having a strong aversion to create conflict, ISFP-Ts are able to effectively work with colleagues to solve problems and get the work done. While they may prefer to work alone, they are able to contribute to a team, especially when in a supportive role. Their passion and singlemindedness in performing tasks may be an asset in some instances, but issues can arise if they are faced with negative feedback or feel they are being micromanaged, without the freedom to work as they like (NERIS Analytics Limited, c 2011). </p>

      <h4>How should I take these into account when forming a team?</h4>
        <p>The best teams should have a mix of people of various personality types in order to bring different perspectives on, and different approaches to, things like identifying issues and problem solving. I would say the ISFP Ts, having a quiet, friendly, non confrontational disposition would help to keep the team on task, find ways to minimise confrontation and contribute effectively to the group to work towards a common goal.</p>

    <h3>VARK LEARNING STYLE TEST</h3>
      <p>One version of the VARK learning style tests was created by Neil Fleming in 1987 as a way to help individuals learn about their optimal learning styles. VARK categorises learners into four types: visual, auditory, reading and writing or kinetic learners (Cherry 2019).</p>

      <h4>Test Results</h4>
        <div class="image">
        <img src="learning_style.png"alt="VARK Learning Style Test Results" class="responsive">
        </div>

      <h4>What do these results mean?</h4>
        <p>An individual with a multimodal learning preference refers to someone who is able to effectively grasp ideas taught to them via different delivery methods. Generally, the majority of people would fall into this category, as education teaching methods today are catered to all types of students (Litonjua 2020). Studies have shown that individuals who are exposed to various teaching methods are more likely to be more engaged, grasp ideas faster and remember them more effectively. They feel comfortable when presented with information in all forms, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>written documentation</li>
            <li>oral presentations</li>
            <li>discussions</li>
            <li>charts, graphs and diagrams</li>
            <li>trial and error</li>
            <li>hands-on experience</li>
          </ul>

      <h4>How do these results influence my behaviour in a team?</h4>
        <p>In a team scenario, having a variety of people each bringing to the group their different understandings and ways of presenting information may be an advantage when working on projects together. However, this may also cause friction in circumstances such as where individuals are unable or unwilling to adjust the way in which they work, such as setting out their process or making their contributions in a written form whereas others prefer a more discussion-based approach (VARK Learn Ltd 2021). In this instance, a multimodal learner, who is able to utilise a variety of different learning styles, may be able to dispel some of this tension by interpreting and explaining for each member the relevant ideas or concepts.</p>

      <h4>How should I take these into account when forming a team?</h4>
        <p>Whether a team is made up of persons who prefer a specific learning style or embraces multiple styles, having a method of working together that is more interactive will be advantageous for all. For instance, during the early stages of a project when discussing the objectives and expected end results, if the initial idea is presented in an oral way, a team member who prefers visual representations may take longer to understand, or not understand at all. However, an interactive process where the information is presented in a variety of different ways will enable all to be on the same page and therefore all will be able to contribute effectively to the project, bringing a variety of different ideas and approaches (Martin 2000).</p>

    <h3>BIG FIVE PERSONALITY TEST</h3>
      <p>The Big Five Personality Test is a personality test that determines how a person rates on a scale of 0 to 100 in relation to five traits being: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (Kelly 2019).</p>

      <h4>Test Results</h4>
        <div class="image">
        <img src="bigFive.png"alt="Big Five Test Results" class="responsive">
        </div>

      <h4>What do these results mean?</h4>
        <p>As the Big Five gives statistical results in relation to five personality traits, it is difficult to categorise people into a specific personality type as the Myers-Briggs test does.  Therefore, it is more appropriate to analyse the results in terms of each individual trait. Persons who score lower in the openness category are typically more conservative in their approaches, less comfortable with adopting abstract ideas and prefer more concrete, practical approaches to things. High conscientiousness scores represent people who are self-disciplined, controlled and focused. They are organised and goal-orientated, prefer sticking to plans and are unlikely to be spontaneous.</p>
        <p>Persons who score low on the extraversion aspect may prefer their own company to others and are also less impulsive than those who score higher, while contradictorily you might think, combined with a high agreeableness score may indicate someone who has a friendly and warm disposition, who is caring and puts others before themselves.  Finally, lower neuroticism scores often denote individuals who are less sensitive to negative emotions and therefore are more stable emotionally (Truity 2020).</p>

      <h4>How do these results influence my behaviour in a team?</h4>
        <p>Given the results of the Big Five, a person with a low openness and extroversion scores, mid-level neuroticism and conscientious scores and who are extremely agreeable would, when working in a team, perhaps tend to prefer to keep in the background, avoid conflict and keep a level head in a similar fashion to those who return the results of the Myers Briggs test above. They would tend to be more organised and diligent, keeping things on track and though less willing to embrace new approaches or ideas, a high agreeableness score would mean they would give their best effort no matter what a team decides (Team Building Portal 2018).</p>

      <h4>How should I take these into account when forming a team?</h4>
        <p>When forming a team, though persons with this type of personality profile would work well with others of the same profile, having a team made up of different personality types would benefit the overall project outcomes. For example, having a team of introverted but agreeable persons who are diligent but conventional in their approaches would perhaps result in limited progress as each gives way to the other and each sticking to tried and tested approaches. However, a balanced team comprised of people with the above profile and other personality types who are more extroverted, impulsive and unconventional would enable greater creativity, promote discussion and collaboration when working together, resulting in better performance(Team Building Portal 2018).</p>

  <h2 id="project">PROJECT IDEA</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>It's late Friday night. The weekend arrives. You have no plans and nowhere to go. You've been shut inside a cubicle for weeks and you've felt the need for excitement and the sky and fresh air building up! What to do? The answer is here: an app that allows you to randomly generate an itinerary for a day trip away from home.</p>
      <p>While there are similar tools around, such as the NRMA Trip Planner or Inspirock, they mostly appear to be targeted to tourists, both overseas and interstate, and those planning longer trips. This app would be targeted to locals who have been to all the tourist places and are in search of something new and different within easy distance of home, to be able to enjoy a day out with enough recovery time to tackle the week ahead.</p>

    <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>Personally, I often find planning for a day trip is worth more trouble than it's worth: finding a suitable location; planning how to get there; finding things to do once you're there (that's not a beach or that won't leave a sizeable dent in your savings). Things may be closed on a particular weekend, require bookings or it's a perfect day outside and you fear all the hubbub around all the popular tourist places that you've been to again and again, so you're on the lookout for a hidden gem. In this case, an app such as this would simplify the planning process and hopefully provide new experiences for users.</p>
      <p>Also, given the current state of the world in terms of the COVID pandemic, while obviously overall tourism numbers have decreased with restrictions on international travel and the threat of snap lockdowns, according to Tourism Research Australia, in the year ending March 2021, day trippers remain one of the main visitor groups to Sydney, accounting for 79% of all visitors, while 21% were domestic overnight travellers (Destination NSW 2021).</p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="tourism.png"alt="Domestic Travel Statistics 2021" class="responsive">
      </div>

      <p>As society slowly emerges from lockdown, Tourism Research Australia predicts the recovery of the tourism industry to be led by domestic travellers, and as such, an app that aids locals to discover and plan new day trips would prove an asset in this scenario.</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>As stated, though there are several online tools that provide a similar service, a simple, user-friendly app that produces results more tailored to domestic travellers who wish to not venture too far but just far enough for a new experience would hopefully be well received. For persons who find it hard to make decisions, having a plan generated to their preferences would be a useful tool.</p>
      <p>The app would begin with asking for user input in relation to parameters such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Day of travel</li>
          <li>Start and finish times (from original location)</li>
          <li>Travel mode (car, train, bus)</li>
          <li>Distance from current location (time or distance-wise)</li>
          <li>Show places that are open only </li>
          <li>Number and types of attractions or places of interest (for example, activity-based or sightseeing) </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The program would then create a day trip using an algorithm based on those inputs, providing an easy and stress-free experience for users, hopefully suggesting new and interesting locations. The user would then also have the option of swapping out specific locations or bypassing them altogether if there is little interest, with the app also showing alternate locations in the area. If altogether undesirable, there would be the option of creating an entirely new trip plan. </p>
        <p>Links to each location generated could be provided, allowing users to directly connect to information about places without having to resort to using a separate search engine so they may consider whether it would be a place they would like to visit. Recommendations in the form of a star rating, for instance, rather than posts from the user could also aid other users in choosing places to visit by being given a higher priority when trip plans are initially created.</p>
        <p>A map feature embedded in the app itself would be beneficial so that the user could be directed to not only the end destinations, but also necessary stops along the way such as places to eat or bathroom breaks without having to resort to another application. Tools such as Google Maps API in addition to a Places API or similar would be necessary in order to easily provide this information. An issue that may arise with this element would be if the user does not wish to allow permissions to their locations which may interfere with the route feature. However, despite this, the app would still be useful in formulating a comprehensive plan of places of interest to visit, and any number of alternative online route planners could be used.</p>
        <p>Though there are clearly a multitude of features that are lacking for an application designed to generate day trip plans, at a base level, features should include things such as:
          <ul>
            <li>Options requiring user input</li>
            <li>Generation of appropriate and suitable locations based on that input</li>
            <li>Descriptions of and links to those locations</li>
            <li>An ability to personalise the plan generated to create a more suitable trip plan</li>
            <li>Route and navigation tools</li>
            <li>Ability to customise the plan in real time as the journey progresses.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <h3>Tools and Technology</h3>
        <p>The main tool that would be necessary for a project such as this would be APIs.  An API is an application programming interface which allows for information from multiple sources to be gathered together and presented in a simple form to the end user (Fitzgerald 2021). Given that this app is based on locations, a navigation API would be essential. The Google Maps API allows developers to create programs that could plan routes and show them on a map for end users (Google Developers 2021). Google's API platform also hosts a number of different APIs which are able to be combined to produce various results, for example, the Places API which uses HTTP requests from other sources to provide information in relation to places of interest relative to a user's location (Helen L 2015).</p>
        <p>For an app such as this, the Google Maps API would not only be necessary for route planning and navigation, but in combination with the Places API would also provide the opportunity for the user to discover new places by providing suggestions based on current location and popularity of places, given the ranking algorithm that both the Places API and Google Maps use.</p>
        <p>Another issue that may arise for a project like this would have to be the creation and maintenance of a database containing a variety of information, some of which would be updated or changed on a regular basis, for instance, opening or closing days or times, especially as a result of things like fast lockdowns or local restrictions. A point of interest API may be of great assistance in this regard. These APIs collect data mainly for the purposes of the tourism industry through processes such as web scraping to collect data from other websites. For example, the New South Wales Government has available for users a dataset last updated in August 2021 called the NSW Points of Interest (POI) dataset, as well as a related ArcGIS REST API which would be beneficial in the development of this project (Spatial Services (DCS), 2018).</p>

      <h3>Skills Required</h3>
        <p>To create an application such as this, an individual must firstly have excellent knowledge of programming languages such as Python or C++ in order to create a program that would be easy and simple to use for the end user, and must also have adequate knowledge in relation to the use of APIs and how to incorporate them into an app. Also, given the ranking feature, an algorithm that is able to adapt to this new information may need to be created, so that those places with increasing popularity, or even new locations which may be added are presented more frequently to the end users.</p>
        <p>Given the abundance of APIs available, the information should be easy to source, however, it would still be up to the developer to use these tools appropriately in order to produce the required outcome. Also, having a design that would be easy, simple to use and engaging would also contribute to the success of this app, and as such, a person who has a sound understanding of web design would also be a benefit.</p>

      <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>For the adventurous, time-strapped domestic traveller, an app like this is sure to save time and make planning for a day out less stressful, and hopefully providing the opportunity to visit new and unexpected places that focuses on small, local businesses and attractions, helping to rebuild the Australian tourism industry one day trip at a time. While there may be difficulties in collecting and collating data initially, and as development of this app progresses and more features are needed, I believe in the long run, especially once the tourism industry returns to a new normal, an ap such as this would surely benefit both users and local businesses.</p>
